# CREHMA.js
CREHMA is end-to-end authenticity and integrity scheme for HTTP messages. CREHMA.js is the reference implementation of CREHMA. To ensure end-to-end authenticity and integrity, CREHMA builds a signature over the whole HTTP message. This signature is then verified by the other endpoint, i.e. client or server.
CREHMA.js is designed to be used in any Javascript-based environemt such as Node, vert.x or in the Webbrowser.
